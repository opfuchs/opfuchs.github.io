I'm OPFUCHS, yet another infosec furry. I'm a red fox who fittingly enough specializes in red (and blue) security operations, as well as open-ended security research into whatever interests me that day. I specialize in doing cybersecurity for financial services, and am currently a graduate student at SANS. 

Most of the posts here will probably be about infosec or infosec-adjacent, but I'll ultimately write about what strikes my fancy, which can sometimes include furry stuff, philosophy, and various other things. 

You can find me on Bluesky @opfuchs.gay
